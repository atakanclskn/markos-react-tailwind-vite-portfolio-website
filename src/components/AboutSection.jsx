            I am an amateur photographer embarking on an exciting journey by opening my own studio.  
            My passion lies in capturing life's moments through various styles of photography, including product shoots, landscapes, portraits, and creative visual storytelling.  
            In addition to photography, I am expanding my skills into video production, offering dynamic and engaging visual content.  
            Through my lens, I aim to create timeless images and films that reflect authenticity, emotion, and artistry.
